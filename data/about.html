<p> On behalf of the Anita Borg Institute, I 
welcome you to the twelfth Grace Hopper 
Celebration of Women in Computing. The 
Anita Borg Institute is building a global community of 
technical women and men from industry, academia, 
and government who are committed to positively 
transform the global technology workplace to one 
that is welcoming to women. I encourage all of our 
attendees to engage in this community, to connect 
with other women, to explore new technologies, and 
to understand how to advance your career. </p>
